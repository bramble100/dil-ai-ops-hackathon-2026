# AI Ops Hackathon 2026 -- LLM Wiki
### BLC + ARC Team

## Slide 1: Pain Points

### Knowledge dies in chat history

- **Rediscovery tax** -- Every time we ask an AI about our documents, it searches from scratch. Nothing is learned, nothing compounds.
- **Scattered sources, no synthesis** -- Annual reports, transcripts, articles, multilingual content -- the connections between them exist only in people's heads.
- **Wikis get abandoned** -- Manual knowledge bases decay because the maintenance burden (cross-references, updates, consistency) grows faster than the value.
- **Point-in-time snapshots** -- Current AI tools produce static reports. Next quarter, you start over.

---

## Slide 2: Who Uses This?

### Anyone who builds knowledge from documents over time

| Team | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **Board Intelligence / Research** | Company profiles from annual reports, filings, transcripts -- auto-updated as new sources arrive |
| **Competitive Intelligence** | Living competitor wikis that evolve with each data point, not one-off reports |
| **Client Onboarding / CS** | Structured knowledge bases from scattered client docs |
| **Any analyst** | Turn a pile of PDFs into a cross-referenced, queryable wiki in hours |

**Our demo proves it:** 12 German PDFs became 35 interconnected financial analysis pages. 11 sources in 4 languages became a 53-page travel guide. No app, no infra -- just Claude Code and markdown.

## Slide 3: Expected Business Impact

### From hours of manual synthesis to minutes of AI compilation

| Metric | Manual Approach | LLM Wiki | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Build a company profile from 12 annual reports** | 2-3 days analyst work | ~2 hours (mostly review) | **~10x faster** |
| **Cross-reference multilingual sources** | Requires language specialists | AI handles 4+ languages natively | **Eliminates language barrier** |
| **Keep wiki current when new data arrives** | Re-read everything, update by hand | Ingest new source, AI updates all affected pages | **Near-zero maintenance** |
| **Onboard someone to a topic** | "Read these 50 docs" | Hand them a structured wiki with an index | **Instant context** |

**Knowledge compounds instead of evaporating.** Every source added makes the wiki richer. Every question asked can become a new page. Traditional AI chat is stateless -- you lose the work the moment you close the window.

## Slide 4: Why AI Is Essential

### This task is impossible without AI -- and trivial with it

- **The bottleneck is bookkeeping, not thinking.** Updating cross-references, flagging contradictions, maintaining consistency across dozens of pages -- humans abandon this work. LLMs don't.
- **Scale breaks humans, not AI.** 88 wiki pages with correct internal links, frontmatter metadata, and source citations across 23 documents -- no human would maintain this by hand.
- **Multilingual synthesis is an AI superpower.** Our Amsterdam wiki was built from Spanish, Hungarian, English, and Dutch sources. The AI read all four and produced a unified English wiki. A human team would need translators.
- **Structure emerges from chaos.** The AI doesn't just summarize -- it creates entity pages, concept pages, comparisons, and time-series analyses. It finds patterns ("3 sources agree on this ranking") that would take hours to spot manually.

> *"LLMs don't get bored, don't forget to update a cross-reference, and can touch 15 files in one pass."* -- Andrej Karpathy

## Slide 5: How It Works

### Three layers, zero infrastructure

```
Raw Sources (you curate)  →  LLM Wiki (AI writes)  ←  Schema (rules & conventions)
PDFs, articles, transcripts     Summaries, entity pages,     Page structure, frontmatter,
in any language                 cross-references, index      ingest workflow, quality gates
```

**The workflow is simple:**
1. **Collect** -- Drop source documents into `raw/` (PDFs, markdown, web clips)
2. **Ingest** -- Tell the AI: "Process this source." It reads, summarizes, creates/updates entity pages, concept pages, comparisons, and the master index
3. **Query** -- Ask questions. Good answers get filed back as wiki pages. Knowledge compounds.
4. **Lint** -- Periodic health check: find contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, missing links

**Stack:** Claude Code + plain markdown + git. No database, no embeddings pipeline, no deployment. Viewable in Obsidian (graph view, backlinks) or any markdown reader.

## Slide 6: Risks, Mitigations & Adoption

### Honest about the risks, clear on the path

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **AI hallucination / inaccuracy** | Every wiki page cites its source. Schema enforces claim types: Source (verbatim), Analysis (inference), Unverified, Gap. Human reviews the output. |
| **Sensitive data in prompts** | All processing is local -- documents stay on your machine, wiki stays in your git repo. No data leaves the controlled environment. |
| **Schema quality = output quality** | We provide battle-tested schemas from our two demos. Bad schema → bad wiki, but this is a solved problem once you have a good template. |
| **"Just another tool to learn"** | There is nothing to learn -- you drop files in a folder and talk to Claude. The wiki is plain markdown anyone can read. |

**Driving adoption:**
- **Start with one real team problem** -- a messy Confluence space, a pile of client PDFs, a competitive landscape nobody maintains
- **The output sells itself** -- hand someone a structured 35-page wiki built from their own documents in 2 hours. That's the demo.
- **Templates, not training** -- ship reusable schemas so any team can start in minutes

## Slide 7: Build Steps & Resources

### Already built -- now it's about scaling the pattern

| Phase | What | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| **Done** | Two working demos (corporate intelligence + travel guide), reusable schemas, README/playbook | Hackathon |
| **Next: Template Library** | Package schemas for common use cases -- company profiles, competitive intel, client onboarding, regulatory research | 1-2 weeks |
| **Next: Team Pilot** | Pick one real team (e.g. Board Intelligence) and build a wiki from their actual documents. Measure time saved vs. current process. | 2-4 weeks |
| **Future: Automation** | Scripted ingest pipelines (watch folders, scheduled refreshes), Obsidian vault as team-shared viewer, integration with DiligentGPT/Glean as a source feeder | Quarter |

**What we need:**
- **Claude Code licenses** for pilot participants (or any LLM agent with filesystem access)
- **A willing pilot team** with a real document problem and 2 hours to spare
- **No infrastructure, no budget, no deployment** -- this runs on a laptop with a git repo

## Slide 8: What We Learned

### Lessons from building two wikis in a day

**On AI in practice:**
- **Schema is everything.** The same AI produces mediocre or excellent output depending on how well you define the rules. Investing 30 minutes in a good schema saves hours of cleanup.
- **Human-in-the-loop beats full automation.** One-at-a-time ingest with review caught errors early. Batch mode was faster but sloppier. The sweet spot is small batches of 3-5 sources.
- **AI handles languages we can't.** Synthesizing Hungarian, Spanish, Dutch, and English sources into one coherent wiki -- no human on our team could have done that.
- **Git + markdown is underrated infra.** Version history, diffs, branching, collaboration -- all free. No vendor lock-in, no migration risk.

**How we'll use AI day-to-day going forward:**
- **Not as a chatbot, but as a knowledge engineer.** The mental model shift from "ask AI a question" to "have AI build and maintain something" changes what's possible.
- **For any recurring research task** -- if you're doing it more than once, the wiki pattern means the second time builds on the first instead of starting over.
